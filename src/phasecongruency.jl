Phase Preserving Dynamic Range Compression

Generates a series of dynamic range compressed images at different scales.
This function is designed to reveal subtle features within high dynamic range
images such as aeromagnetic and other potential field grids. Often this kind
of data is presented using histogram equalisation in conjunction with a
rainbow colourmap. A problem with histogram equalisation is that the contrast
amplification of a feature depends on how commonly its data value occurs,
rather than on the amplitude of the feature itself. 

Phase Preserving Dynamic Range Compression allows subtle features to be
revealed without these distortions. Perceptually important phase information
is preserved and the contrast amplification of anomalies in the signal is
purely a function of their amplitude. It operates as follows: first a highpass
filter is applied to the data, this controls the desired scale of analysis.
The 2D analytic signal of the data is then computed to obtain local phase and
amplitude at each point in the image. The amplitude is attenuated by adding 1
and then taking its logarithm, the signal is then reconstructed using the
original phase values.

```
Usage: dimg = ppdrc(img, wavelength; clip, n)

Arguments:     img - Image to be processed. A 2D array of Real or Gray elements.
        wavelength - Scalar value, or Vector, of wavelengths, in pixels, of 
                     the cut-in frequencies to be used when forming the highpass
                     versions of the image.  Try a range of values starting
                     with, say, a wavelength corresponding to half the size
                     of the image and working down to something like 50
                     grid units. 
Keyword arguments:
              clip - Percentage of output image histogram to clip.  Only a
                     very small value should be used, say 0.01 or 0.02, but 
                     this can be beneficial.  Defaults to 0.01%
                 n - Order of the Butterworth high pass filter.  Defaults
                     to 2

Returns:      dimg - Array of the dynamic range reduced images.  If only
                     one wavelength is specified the image is returned 
                     directly, and not as a one element array of image arrays.
```

Important: Scaling of the image affects the results.  If your image has values
of order 1 or less it is useful to scale the image up a few orders of magnitude.
The reason is that when the frequency amplitudes are attenuated we add one
before taking the log to avoid obtaining negative results for values less than
one.  Thus if `v` is small `log(1 + v)` will not be a good approximation to `log(v)`.
However, if you scale the image by say, 1000 then `log(1 + 1000*v)` will be a reasonable
approximation to `log(1000*v)`.

When specifying the array `wavelength` it is suggested that you use wavelengths
that increase in a geometric series.  You can use the function `geoseries()` to
conveniently do this
 
Example using `geoseries()` to generate a set of wavelengths that increase
geometrically in 10 steps from 50 to 800. 
```
   dimg = ppdrc(img, geoseries((50 800), 10))
```

# phasecongmono
"""
Phase congruency of an image using monogenic filters.

This code is considerably faster than `phasecong3()` but you may prefer the
output from `phasecong3()`'s oriented filters.

There are potentially many arguments, here is the full usage:
```
  (PC, or, ft, T) =  
          phasecongmono(img; nscale, minwavelength, mult, 
                        sigmaonf, k, cutoff, g, deviationgain, noisemethod)

However, apart from the image, all parameters have defaults and the
usage can be as simple as:

   (PC,) = phasecongmono(img)   # Use (PC,) so that PC is not a tuple of all
                                # the returned values

More typically you will pass the image followed by a series of keyword
arguments that you wish to set, leaving the remaining parameters set to
their defaults, for example:

   (PC,) = phasecongmono(img, nscale = 5, minwavelength = 3, k = 2.5)

Keyword arguments:
             Default values      Description

   nscale           4    - Number of wavelet scales, try values 3-6
                           A lower value will reveal more fine scale
                           features. A larger value will highlight 'major'
                           features.
   minwavelength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
   mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
   sigmaonf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
                           describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
                           in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
   k                3.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
                           the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
                           You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
                           20 for noisy images 
   cutoff           0.5  - The fractional measure of frequency spread
                           below which phase congruency values get penalized.
   g                10   - Controls the sharpness of the transition in
                           the sigmoid function used to weight phase
                           congruency for frequency spread.                        
   deviationgain    1.5  - Amplification to apply to the calculated phase
                           deviation result. Increasing this sharpens the
                           edge responses, but can also attenuate their
                           magnitude if the gain is too large.  Sensible
                           values to use lie in the range 1-2.
   noisemethod      -1   - Parameter specifies method used to determine
                           noise statistics. 
                             -1 use median of smallest scale filter responses
                             -2 use mode of smallest scale filter responses
                              0+ use noiseMethod value as the fixed noise threshold 
                           A value of 0 will turn off all noise compensation.

Returned values:
   PC         - Phase congruency indicating edge significance
   or         - Orientation image in radians -pi/2 to pi/2,  +ve anticlockwise.
                0 corresponds to a vertical edge, pi/2 is horizontal.
   ft         - Local weighted mean phase angle at every point in the
                image.  A value of pi/2 corresponds to a bright line, 0
                corresponds to a step and -pi/2 is a dark line.
   T          - Calculated noise threshold (can be useful for
                diagnosing noise characteristics of images).  Once you know
                this you can then specify fixed thresholds and save some
                computation time.
```
The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
experiment with the values of `nscales` and `k`, the noise compensation
factor.

Typical sequence of operations to obtain an edge image:
```
 > (PC, or) = phasecongmono(img)
 > nm = nonmaxsup(PC, or, 1.5)   # nonmaxima suppression
 > bw = hysthresh(nm, 0.1, 0.3)  # hysteresis thresholding 0.1 - 0.3

Notes on filter settings to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
sigmaonf       .85   mult 1.3
sigmaonf       .75   mult 1.6     (filter bandwidth ~1 octave)
sigmaonf       .65   mult 2.1  
sigmaonf       .55   mult 3       (filter bandwidth ~2 octaves)
```
Note that better results are generally achieved using the large
bandwidth filters.  I typically use a `sigmaOnf` value of 0.55 or even
smaller.

# phasesymmono
"""
Phase symmetry of an image using monogenic filters.

This function calculates the phase symmetry of points in an image.
This is a contrast invariant measure of symmetry.  This function can be
used as a line and blob detector.  The greyscale polarity of the lines
that you want to find can be specified.

This code is considerably faster than `phasesym()` but you may prefer the
output from `phasesym()`'s oriented filters.

There are potentially many arguments, here is the full usage:
```
  (phSym, symmetryEnergy, T) = 
               phasesymmono(img; nscale, minwaveLength, mult,
                            sigmaonf, k, polarity, noisemethod)
```
However, apart from the image, all parameters have defaults and the
usage can be as simple as:
```
   (phSym,) = phasesymmono(img)
 
Keyword arguments:
             Default values      Description

   nscale           5    - Number of wavelet scales, try values 3-6
   minwaveLength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
   mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
   sigmaonf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
                           describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
                           in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
   k                2.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
                           the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
                           You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
                           20 for noisy images 
   polarity         0    - Controls 'polarity' of symmetry features to find.
                            1 - just return 'bright' points
                           -1 - just return 'dark' points
                            0 - return bright and dark points.
   noisemethod      -1   - Parameter specifies method used to determine
                           noise statistics. 
                             -1 use median of smallest scale filter responses
                             -2 use mode of smallest scale filter responses
                              0+ use noiseMethod value as the fixed noise threshold 
                           A value of 0 will turn off all noise compensation.

Return values:
   phSym                 - Phase symmetry image (values between 0 and 1).
   symmetryEnergy        - Un-normalised raw symmetry energy which may be
                           more to your liking.
   T                     - Calculated noise threshold (can be useful for
                           diagnosing noise characteristics of images)
```

The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
experiment with the values of `nscales` and `k`, the noise compensation factor.

Notes on filter settings to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
```

                             to the filter center frequency. 
   orientWrap       false    Optional Boolean flag  to turn on/off
                             'wrapping' of orientation data from a
                             range of -pi .. pi to the range 0 .. pi.
                             This affects the interpretation of the
                             phase angle - see note below. Defaults to false.
Returns:
       f  - vector of bandpass filter responses with respect to scale.
     h1f  - vector of bandpass h1 filter responses wrt scale.
     h2f  - vector of bandpass h2 filter responses.
       A  - vector of monogenic energy responses.
   theta  - vector of phase orientation responses.
     psi  - vector of phase angle responses.
```
If `orientWrap` is true `theta` will be returned in the range `0 .. pi`

Experimentation with `sigmaonf` can be useful depending on your application.
I have found values as low as 0.2 (a filter with a *very* large bandwidth)
to be useful on some occasions.

   img                       Image to be convolved.

   sigmaOnf        = 0.65    Ratio of the standard deviation of the

                             transfer function in the frequency domain
                             to the filter center frequency.
   dThetaOnSigma   = 1.3     Ratio of angular interval between filter

                             construct filters in the freq. plane.
   Lnorm            0        Optional integer indicating what norm the
                             filters should be normalized to.  A value of 1
                             will produce filters with the same L1 norm, 2
                             will produce filters with matching L2
                             norm. the default value of 0 results in no

       symmetric filter, the imaginary part is the result from
       convolution with the odd symmetric filter.

       Hence:
       abs.(EO[s,o]) returns the magnitude of the convolution over the
                    image at scale s and orientation o.
       angle.(EO[s,o]) returns the phase angles.

The determination of `mult` given `sigmaOnf` is entirely empirical.  What I do is
plot out the sum of the squared filter amplitudes in the frequency domain and
see how even the coverage of the spectrum is.  If there are concentric 'gaps'
in the spectrum one needs to reduce mult and/or reduce `sigmaOnf` (which
increases filter bandwidth)

If there are 'gaps' radiating outwards then one needs to reduce `dthetaOnSigma`
(increasing angular bandwidth of the filters)

Computes edge and corner phase congruency in an image via log-Gabor filters.

There are potentially many arguments, here is the full usage:

                          mult, sigmaonf, k, cutoff, g, noisemethod)
```

However, apart from the image, all parameters have defaults and the
usage can be as simple as:
```
    (M,) = phasecong3(img)
 
Keyword Arguments:
             Default values      Description

   nscale           4    - Number of wavelet scales, try values 3-6
   norient          6    - Number of filter orientations.
   minwavelength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
   mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
   sigmaonf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
                           describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
                           in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
   k                2.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
                           the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
                           You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
                           20 for noisy images 
   cutoff           0.5  - The fractional measure of frequency spread
                           below which phase congruency values get penalized.
   g                10   - Controls the sharpness of the transition in
                           the sigmoid function used to weight phase
                           congruency for frequency spread.                        
   noisemethod      -1   - Parameter specifies method used to determine
                           noise statistics. 
                             -1 use median of smallest scale filter responses
                             -2 use mode of smallest scale filter responses
                              0+ use noisemethod value as the fixed noise threshold 

Returned values:
   M          - Maximum moment of phase congruency covariance.
                This is used as a indicator of edge strength.
   m          - Minimum moment of phase congruency covariance.
                This is used as a indicator of corner strength.
   or         - Orientation image in radians -pi/2 to pi/2,  +ve anticlockwise.
                0 corresponds to a vertical edge, pi/2 is horizontal.
   ft         - Local weighted mean phase angle at every point in the
                image.  A value of pi/2 corresponds to a bright line, 0
                corresponds to a step and -pi/2 is a dark line.
   EO         - A 2D array of complex valued convolution results for each scale 
                and orientation
   T          - Calculated noise threshold (can be useful for
                diagnosing noise characteristics of images).  Once you know
                this you can then specify fixed thresholds and save some
                computation time.
```
`EO[s,o]` = convolution result for scale `s` and orientation `o`.  The real part
is the result of convolving with the even symmetric filter, the imaginary
part is the result from convolution with the odd symmetric filter.

  Hence:
      `abs.(EO[s,o])` returns the magnitude of the convolution over the
      image at scale `s` and orientation `o`,  
      `angle.(EO[s,o])` returns the phase angles.
   
The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
experiment with the values of `nscales` and `k`, the noise compensation factor.

Some filter parameters to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
```
sigmaonf       .85   mult 1.3
sigmaonf       .75   mult 1.6     (filter bandwidth ~1 octave)

# phasesym
"""
Compute phase symmetry on an image via log-Gabor filters.

This function calculates the phase symmetry of points in an image.
This is a contrast invariant measure of symmetry.  This function can be
used as a line and blob detector.  The greyscale polarity of the lines
that you want to find can be specified.

```
Usage:   (phSym, orientation, totalEnergy, T) = 
                phasesym(img; nscale = 5, norient = 6, minwavelength = 3, mult = 2.1, 
                         sigmaonf = 0.55, k = 2, polarity = 0, noisemethod = -1)

However, apart from the image, all parameters have defaults and the
usage can be as simple as:

    (phSym,) = phasesym(img)

Argument:
                    img  - Image to be processed. 2D Array of Real or Gray
 
Keyword Arguments:
              Default values      Description

    norient          6    - Number of filter orientations.
    minwavelength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
    mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
    sigmaonf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
                            describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
                            in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
    k                2.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
                            the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
                            You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
                            20 for noisy images 
    polarity         0    - Controls 'polarity' of symmetry features to find.
                             1 - just return 'bright' points
                            -1 - just return 'dark' points
                             0 - return bright and dark points.
    noisemethod      -1   - Parameter specifies method used to determine
                            noise statistics. 
                              -1 use median of smallest scale filter responses
                              -2 use mode of smallest scale filter responses
                               0+ use noiseMethod value as the fixed noise threshold.

Return values:
    phSym                 - Phase symmetry image (values between 0 and 1).
    orientation           - Orientation image. Orientation in which local
                            symmetry energy is a maximum, in radians
                            (-pi/2 - pi/2), angles positive anti-clockwise. Note
                            the orientation info is quantized by the number
                            of orientations
    totalEnergy           - Un-normalised raw symmetry energy which may be
                            more to your liking.
    T                     - Calculated noise threshold (can be useful for
                            diagnosing noise characteristics of images).  Once you know
                            this you can then specify fixed thresholds and save some
                            computation time.
```

The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
experiment with the values of `nscales` and `k`, the noise compensation factor.

# ppdenoise
"""
Phase preserving wavelet image denoising.

```
Usage: cleanimage = ppdenoise(img,  nscale = 5, norient = 6,
                              mult = 2.5, minwavelength = 2, sigmaonf = 0.55, 
                              dthetaonsigma = 1.0, k = 3, softness = 1.0)
Argument:
          img - Image to be processed (greyscale)

Keyword arguments:
        nscale - No of filter scales to use (5-7) - the more scales used
                 the more low frequencies are covered.
       norient - No of orientations to use (6)
          mult - Multiplying factor between successive scales  (2.5-3)
 minwavelength - Wavelength of smallest scale filter (2)
      sigmaonf - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
                 describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
                 in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency (0.55)
 dthetaonsigma - Ratio of angular interval between filter orientations
                 and the standard deviation of the angular Gaussian (1)
                 function used to construct filters in the freq. plane.
             k - No of standard deviations of noise to reject 2-3
      softness - Degree of soft thresholding (0-hard to 1-soft)
```

The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate
to the specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  Most
arguments do not need to be changed from the defaults and are mostly
not that critical.  The main parameter that you may wish to play with
is `k`, the number of standard deviations of noise to reject.
