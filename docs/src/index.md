This package provides a collection of image processing functions that exploit
the importance of phase information in our perception of images. The functions
form two main groups:

1) Functions that detect specific patterns of local phase for the purpose of feature detection.  

2) Functions that enhance an image in a way that does not corrupt the local phase so that our perception of important features are not disrupted.

## Feature detection via phase congruency

|.  |   |
|---|---|
|![](testimg.png)              |![](examples/covers/phasecongmono.png)           |

Rather than assume a feature is a point of maximal intensity gradient, the Local
Energy Model postulates that features are perceived at points in an image where
the Fourier components are maximally in phase. (See the Fourier Series logo of
this page).  This model was developed by Morrone et al. [1986] and Morrone and
Owens [1987].  Kovesi [1997, 1999, 2002] subsequently developed methods of
computing phase congruency from quadrature pairs of log-Gabor wavelets.

Phase congruency is an illumination and contrast invariant measure of feature
significance. Unlike gradient based feature detectors, which can only detect
step features, phase congruency correctly detects features at all kind of phase
angle, and not just step features having a phase angle of 0 or 180 degrees.
Another key attribute is that phase congruency is a dimensionless quantity
ranging from 0 to 1, making it contrast invariant. This allows fixed threshold
values to be used over large classes of images.

## Phase symmetry

|.  |   |
|---|---|
|![](blobs.png) |![](examples/covers/phasesymmetry.gif) |

A point of local symmetry in an image corresponds to a point where the local
frequency components are at either the minimum or maximum points in their
cycles, that is, where all the frequency components are at the most symmetric
points in their cycles. Like phase congruency, phase symmetry is a dimensionless
quantity.

## Phase preserving denoising

|.  |   |
|---|---|
| ![](testimgplusnoise.png) | ![](examples/covers/ppdenoise.png) |

This is a wavelet denoising scheme that uses non-orthogonal, complex valued,
log-Gabor wavelets, rather than the more usual orthogonal or bi-orthogonal
wavelets. Thresholding of wavelet responses in the complex domain allows one to
ensure that perceptually important phase information in the image is not
corrupted. It is also allows threshold values can be determined automatically
from the statistics of the wavelet responses to the image.

* [Example](@ref demo_ppdenoise) of using `ppdenoise()`.


## Phase preserving dynamic range compression

|.  |   |
|---|---|
|![](m51.png) |![](examples/covers/ppdrc.png)|

A common method for displaying images with a high dynamic range is to use some
variant of histogram equalization.  The problem with histogram equalization is
that the contrast amplification of a feature depends on how commonly its data
value occurs and this can lead to some undesirable distortions in the relative
amplitudes of features.  Phase Preserving Dynamic Range Compression allows
subtle features in images to be revealed without these distortions. It also
allows the scale of analysis to be controlled. Perceptually important phase
information is preserved and the contrast amplification of structures in the
signal is purely a function of their amplitude.
